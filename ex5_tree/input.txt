I will give you some advice about life.Eat more roughage.Do more than others expect you to do and do it pains.Remember what life tells you.Do not take to heart every thing you hear.Do not spend all that you have.Do not sleep as long as you want.Whenever you say" I love you", please say it honestly.Whevever you say"I am sorry", please look into the other person's eyes.
